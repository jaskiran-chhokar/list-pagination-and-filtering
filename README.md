# List Pagination and Filtering 

For this project, I utilized a web development technique called pagination to enhance the user experience of a website that serves the purpose of displaying a long list of student profiles/accounts.

In addition to this, I also created a dynamic search component that filters based on student names. The search component is developed in such a way where it also paginates search results in real-time. 

### Skills
To code out the functionality for this website, I used Vanilla JavaScript (ES6). 

### Techniques 
As I was making improvements to this website, I kept the principal of "progressive enhancement" in mind. I wanted the website to be able to look nice and presentable even if we took the JavaScript code away. Although, the page will still display student names without JavaScript being enabled, it will be a much more improved/enhanced experience when it is.
